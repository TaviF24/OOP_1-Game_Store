# Online Game Store

## About
My first OOP project where I made an online game store simulator.

In this project, I had to hit different points:
- having at least a class
- constructor, copy constructor, destructor
- dynamic memory allocation (new and delete)
- operator overloading
- not using any STL elements
- having GETTERS and SETTERS
- overloading input/output operators
- the programm should be able to store and delete any number of elements
- having an interactive menu

## What I used
- MacOS
- Clion 2022.3.2
- C++
